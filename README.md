This Project was meant to be the introduction to graphical projects in the curriculum.
As the first project featuring graphics, getting comfortable with a foreign codebase called MLX42 was the first hurdle to overcome. 
This included learning the features, and concepts of a window manager, as well as on how to display information in a graphical manner onto a screen.

Since this project introduced a 3d manner of displaying a grid it served as a good introduction into the structure of implementing interactivity with the displayed information such as keystrokes mouse controls and which visual changes adjustments to the values of the grid caused.

Below is an example of the project:

<!-- <div> Insert video of mesh moving and changing values here</div> -->
